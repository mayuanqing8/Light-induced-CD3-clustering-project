# Light-induced-CD3-clustering-project
Here is a list of matlab script and custom functions I have used for the light induced CD3zeta clustering project. The code are used mainly for the image analysis for the project. The code  requires the data be pretreated, for image analysis, the images need to be converted to multiple channel Tiff hyperstacks, or single channel tiff image stacks where the channel images are stacked sequentially.  There is also a script for loading the post analyzed data for the line scanning FSCS data, which was exported from LabView software as excel.xlsx format. 

if you have any quetions, please email me (mayuanqing8@gmail.com) for details.
