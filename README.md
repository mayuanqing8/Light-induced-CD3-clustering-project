# Light-induced-CD3-clustering-project
this is a list of matlab code that I have used for the light induced CD3zeta clustering project.

the following include list of matlab script and custom functions (loading images and image filtering etc.,) used for mainly for the image analysis for the project.  The code  requires the data be pretreated, for image analysis, the images need to be converted to multiple channel Tiff hyperstacks,   or single channel tiff image stacks where the channel images are stacked sequentially. 

if you have any quetions, please email me (mayuanqing8@gmail.com) for details.
